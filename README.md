# processing radiosondes for the SONATA dataset

This repository aims at processing the radisondes data similarly to [Pysonde](https://github.com/observingClouds/pysonde/tree/master). However, it only processes the data up to level 1 and then prepares the data in a similar format as the level 2 data for dropsondes.

The interpolation is then performed with the dropsonde processing code for consistency.
